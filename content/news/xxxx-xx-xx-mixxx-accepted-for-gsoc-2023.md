Mixxx has been [accepted as a mentoring organization](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/organizations/mixxx) for [Google Summer of Code 2023](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), a global program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development.

This means that new or even established contributors of Mixxx have the opportunity to work on Mixxx full-time during the summer for 12+ weeks while receiving a stipend sponsored by Google. For more information, check out the [Google Summer of Code Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/).

You will find the [GSoC 2023 Project Ideas for Mixxx](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/GSOC-2023-Ideas) in our wiki, but your own ideas are also more than welcome. Taking a look at our [GSoC advice page](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/gsocadvice) is recommended if you're planning to apply. The best way to get started is to participate in the Mixxx community, so have a look at our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx) and consider making a small code contribution to show that you're able to familiarize yourself with our code base.

You could also help us, even if you are no GSoC candidate yourself. Simply print out a [flyer](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/GSoC-Flyers) and post it on the bulletin board of your local university.

If you are interested in last years projects, take a look at the blog post of [David Chocholatý](https://mixxx.org/news/2022-09-08-gsoc-final-blog-david-chocholaty) and [Fatih Emre YILDIZ](https://mixxx.org/news/2022-09-26-gsoc-final-blog-fatih-emre-yildiz). Their work will have a great benefit for our users in the upcoming Mixxx version 2.4. You can already test them in a development snapshot of [2.4-alpha](https://downloads.mixxx.org/snapshots/2.4)

The official application period will start **March 20th** and ends on **April 2th**, so have your applications ready in time. Potential GSoC contributors should start discussing their application ideas on our [Zulip](https://mixxx.zulipchat.com/) now. Just start a new topic in the [#gsoc](https://mixxx.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/109215-gsoc) stream. Please understand that we only engage with potential contributors via the respective channels in the [#gsoc](https://mixxx.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/109215-gsoc) stream on Zulip or via the official GSoC application process.
