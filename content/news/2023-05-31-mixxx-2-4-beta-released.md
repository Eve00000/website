It's been a while, but after almost exactly 3 years, we're proud to announce the
beta version of the next major release: Mixxx 2.4!  
Keep your eyes peeled for the stable version of 2.4 being released in August if
everything goes according to plan. In the meantime, we need help from **YOU**!
In order to get 2.4 stable, we need lots of people testing this beta release,
the more, the better. Please [download it](https://mixxx.org/download/#beta) and
report any bugs you find on [our
bugtracker](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/issues).

Here's a quick look at the most important changes and new features you can look
forward to in Mixxx 2.4:

* Support for saving loops as hotcues ("Saved Loops").
* Save effect chains and then load them into effect units or the QuickEffect
* Native Apple Silicon support (better performance on M1/M2/etc. devices).
* Explicit Sync leader.
* New controller mapping scripting engine (ES2016 support).
* New "all-shaders" Scrolling waveforms resulting in much better GUI performance
  on all platforms (_especially MacOS_).
* A bunch of polish for the Library.

Expect a more in depth blog posts for each of these features in the coming
weeks.
