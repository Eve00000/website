Hello Everybody.

After thorough preparation, we're finally moving from Launchpad bugs to GitHub
issues. We'll publish a more detailed blogpost after the migration is done. For
now, We'd just like to let everybody know, that we will disable [our bug tracker
on launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx) sometime on Monday the 22nd of
August. Any activity on Launchpad after that point will not be carried over to
GitHub. Any already existing link to an issue on Launchpad will still continue
to work, but you will not be able to search for them on Launchpad anymore. Once
the migration has been completed, the more detailed blog post will be published
and you will be able to interact with the newly migrated issues on [our GitHub
repository](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/issues).

Thank you all for your patience during the migration.
