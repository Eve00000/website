[Google Summer of Code 2013]({static}/images/news/image00.jpg)

Google has [just announced](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/04/mentoring-organizations-for-google.html) the participating mentoring organizations for [Google Summer of Code 2013](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013) and **[Mixxx has
been accepted](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/mixxx)** into the program!

Google Summer of Code is a global program that allows students to receive a $5000 USD stipend for writing code for an open source software project over the summer.
Students can apply by submitting an application to a mentoring organization (like us) via the [GSoC 2013](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013) website.
For more information about how GSoC works, please see the [program FAQ](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page).

To get prospective students started, we've put up a list of [GSoC 2013 Project Ideas for Mixxx](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/gsoc2013ideas) on our wiki, but we're always interested in new ideas.
We also recommend taking a peek at our page of [general advice for students](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/gsocadvice) interested in applying.
**The application period for students begins on April 22nd and ends May 3rd at 19:00 UTC.**

Our past summer projects have included rewriting our scrolling waveform widgets, adding Shoutcast broadcasting support to Mixxx, and improving our audio mixer routing code.
A full list of our past GSoC projects is available on the [front page](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki#google_summer_of_code) of our wiki.

Interested? [Apply starting April 22nd](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/mixxx) and come hack on the best free MP3 DJ mixing software for the Summer!
