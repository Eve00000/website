Google has accepted two [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)new contributor's projects for Mixxx. GSoC is a stipend program that allows new contributors to work Mixxx on their own ~175 hours or ~350 hours project.

This year [Fatih Emre YILDIZ](https://github.com/fatihemreyildiz) and [David Chocholatý](https://github.com/davidchocholaty) have been successful with their applications. Congratulations!

David Chocholatý will implement a pitch shift and auto-tune effect, that will allow to get creative with loops and samples altering the pitch or even play melodies.

Fatih Emre YILDIZ will add a track suggestion feature that fetches track suggestions from online sources. These information can then be used to make the random track selection in Auto Dj more reasonable or help the user to keep the crowd dancing even if he is out of ideas for a successor track.

We will discuss the project details in our pulic [Zulip](https://mixxx.zulipchat.com), so that anyone can follow their progress or getting involved with own ideas or reviews.
