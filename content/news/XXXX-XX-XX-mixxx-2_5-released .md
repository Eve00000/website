title: Mixxx 2.5 Release Announcement

tags: 2.5, release announcement
comments: yes
status: draft

#### All I want for DJ-ing is ...

Home alone? Scrooged? The sound of music? Die hard?
Change plans: this year you will be having something better to do than watching old Christmas movies.
Mixxx is now your secret "Santa comin' to town", our elves had "good hearts with the burning desire to work hard",
to get you "Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the party hop" with "something mighty sweet to see".
"For the present, look high, not low": Mixxx's "presents 'neath the tree"

#### So this is the last goodbye ...

Important: OS-Support.
macOS versions earlier than 11 can have a "Last Christmas".
Windows versions earlier than version 10 build 1809 can be "Driving home for Christmas".
For Ubuntu versions earlier than 22.04 "Christmas Will Break Your Heart".
By stepping over from QT5 to QT6.5 Mixxx has to respect the minimum system requirements stated by QT for the official builds.
That's why the support has been dropped for macOS earlier than 11, Windows versions earlier then version 10 buikd 1889 and Ubuntu earlier then 22.04.

#### Let's cheer for the elves

Ho Ho Ho, our sleigh is filled with many shiny presents:

* A red box filled with brand new waveform textures and features: 'SlipMode waveform' gives you visual aid
while scratchin', the 'beats until next marker' helps you never missing the break, the GL ES support makes it
run smooth and many more...

@Video([https://youtu.be/QUuiu7BlCzI])

@Video([https://youtu.be/Xi3Ec0Jo-z8])

* With a nice yellow bow around it, the new Skin & Interface features: the menubar can be hidden,
reworked toggles (fullscreen, cue popup, vinyl control), improved tooltips, improved controls and checks (AutoDJ,
effects), new command line interface options...

@Video([https://youtu.be/tUYfLxeQh2o])

* Our engine became a V8 sleigh: undo function for BPM/beats, beatloop anchor, rate tap button...
* "Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer" will sound much better with the compressor and glitch effects and the improved backend.

@Video([https://youtu.be/W2Gjdv3R6BM])

* Your "Jingles" and "Bells" can be sorted and found easier with the new library features: Cut, Copy and Paste in tracklists,
tracks can be moved with ALT+Up/Down/PgUp/PgDn, the searchengine received new BPM filters, an 'OR'-operator, new import possibilities,
custom track colors for missing or played tracks ...

@Video([https://youtu.be/IOUv255xH20])

* "Santa Tell Me" what's new in preferences: some improved layout, the fetching of the soundcard's sample rate is fixed,
a new setting for 'first hotcue', multiple options can be selected in the MIDI input editor...
* Many "Days Of Christmas" full of improved Controller Mappings for Denon MC7000, Numark Scratch, Pioneer DDJ-FLX4, Traktor Kontrol S4 MK3 and MIDI for light.
* A Controller Backend as a "Fairytale of New York" to map your controller: sysex, deck's track menu, support for bulk devices,
drop of lodash dependency...
* The experimental QML Skin is a "Playerâ€™s Ball", an appetizer for the future GUI of Mixxx.
* QT5 will Be Home For Christmas because Mixxx is using [QT6](https://www.qt.io/product/qt6) now, a lot of work has been put
in study, preparation, testing, upgrading procedures, adapting routines, dialogs, widgets, libraries.
Upgrading to QT6 wasn't just sitting "underneath the Mistletoe" but now Mixxx is in "Winter Wonderland".
"Thank you Santa" Developers!
* "Feliz" iOs & WebAssembly: experiments are on-going to run Mixxx on iOs and in a Webbrowser.
* So many rafactorings have been made, improvements of the code by progressive insight, because of new
possibilities in c++ and QT, because of studies in acoustics, user experiences...
The list is too long to write or make a selection here, it would be failing all contributors,
you can find the complete list further in this announcement, full of "Christmas Lights"


#### So this is Christmas

"Baby, It's Cold Outside", so our present will be lots of fun exploring this new version.
You'll need quiet some time to get used to all new features, discover the real possibilities,
to get some adapted workflow with new handles.
Mixxx whishes you a "Wonderful Christmas Time".

Mic drop, "Light the Candles All Around the World"


#### ... and a happy 2.5
