Dear Mixxx-ers,

The Mixxx-developing started the year with good intentions and therefore imposed itself some deadlines. That is why only two monthes after version 2.4, 

the next release: version 2.4.1 can be offered. This isn't just a service release fixing some minor bugs and problems, version 2.4.1 contains some nice

features. Hiding them longer for you could possibly been seen as a crime.

Before listing the details, I would like to share some memorable moments I could follow in the Zulip-chat that are significant for the atmosphere and 

motivation of the Mixxx-team:

* Ten days ago a Mixxx-er posted a problem that he was struggling with for over a year. He was unable to make a MIDI-connection between his Pioneer 
* DJM-750MK2 MMixer with Mixxx and then activate the DVS (Digital Vinyl System) to work with Mixxx's Vinyl Control. A Mixxx-developer took the challenge and
* during 2 weeks you could see the messages flying over: log-files, screenshots, debugging-info, tooltests, capturing communication, a new pull request...
* I think I've seen over 100 messages. Trying things, fail, one step forward, two steps back ... After 2 weeks the Mixxx-developer managed to get it fixed.
* All on distance, not having the hardware available, putting a lot of time in it. It was fantastic to witness it.
* Shout out to N/S!

* About three weeks ago a Mixxx-developer proposed a new feature: showing the remaining beats till the next cue point in the waveform.
* After some writing, testing, rewriting ... he created a feature I couldn't miss anymore. If you make a hotcue at eg. climax or a loop or an intro start
* in a song you can see the remaining time (or # beats) until this point in the waveform. Once a DJ has used this feature, she/he can't without it.
* This feature will be available in the 2.5
* Shout out to m! 

No cure for the spreading Mixxx-virus, you 're all invited to join the Mixxx-team. 

And now the 'what's new / what's changed / what's corrected' in 2.4.1:
