# Mixxx 2.3.3 Released

Its that time again! ðŸŽ‰
Almost a year after [the release of 2.3.0]({filename}/news/2021-06-28-mixxx-2-3-0-released.md)
we're bringing you the next bugfix release [Mixxx 2.3.3](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/releases/tag/2.3.3).

This release features - you guessed it - various bugfixes and improvements:
But since we're not your run-off-the-mill mobile App, we'll get a bit into
detail:

A bunch of controller mappings have received various improvements,
such as the Pioneer-DDJ-SB3, the NI Traktor S3, Behringer DDM4000 and Denon MC7000.
We've also addressed some long-standing bugs in our controller engine and the
Auto DJ, smoothed out the preference dialog and fixed a bunch of possibly
show-stopping bugs. ðŸ˜¬ ðŸ˜Œ

As usual, we recommend you update to the [newest stable version by visiting our
download page]({filename}/pages/download.md#stable)
