Hello Everybody.

After much preparation, we're moving from Launchpad to Github issues. We'll
publish a more detailed blogpost after the migration is done. For now, We'd
just like to let everybody know, that we will disable [our bugtracker on
launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx) sometime afternoon Monday the 22.
of August. Any activity on Launchpad from that point on will not be carried over
to Github. Any already existing link to an issue on Launchpad will still
continue to work, but you will not be able to search for them on Launchpad anymore. Once the
migration has been completed, the more detailed blogpost will be published and
you will be able to continue to interact with the newly migrated Issues on [our
Github repository](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/issues).

Thank you all for your patience during the migration.
