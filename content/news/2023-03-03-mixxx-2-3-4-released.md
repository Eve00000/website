You know the drill, another 2.3 bugfix release. [Mixxx
2.3.4](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/releases/tag/2.3.4) to be exact.

Let's take a look at the changes:  
macOS received a bunch of love, especially in regards to possible UI performance
problems and translation issues. We also enabled support for macOS 13 (Ventura)
on Intel-CPUs, while there is still some work in progress to support Apple
silicon from Mixxx 2.4.0.  
In addition, our Tango and LateNight skins received a lot of minor tweaks and
visual fixes.  
Issues occurring during metadata import from 3rd party software were also fixed.
This includes issues when fetching data from MusicBrainz as well as importing
metadata from Rekordbox databases or music files containing Serato metadata.

Since we include controller mappings in bugfix releases, we can also announce
that we gained support for the Traktor Kontrol S2 Mk1 and the Numark Party Mix.  
Some existing mappings also received some attention, especially Numark ones
because plenty of community members discovered that the Pitch/Rate-slider was
inverted in a couple mappings.

That's about all for 2.3.4. If you're interested in the full changelog, you can
