#### Winter and Summer are coming

Contrasts.
As the leaves fall and the first snowflakes start drifting down in the North, while the southern skies start warming up
with summer sun, we are thrilled to finally release Mixxx 2.4.2! Finally because a bit later than planned, we would like
to apologize for the delay but we can't release a non-prefect version. This release is a major bugfix-release for the
2.4 series before stepping over to a new number.
This release covers a lot of issues reported by our users and contains updates for many controller-mappings.
Don't be scared, development won't hibernate.

#### Testing and translating

A special thank you to everyone who takes the time to test alfa and beta versions, to who report issues and proposes and to those
who propose features and improvements. Your feedback is invaluable.
A lot of new users and contributors have joined our community the past months, we'd like to welcome them all, spin it up,
your energy and fresh ideas have already left a mark.
Everybody can contribute to Mixxx. Did you remark an error on the website, an incomplete subject in the manual, an error in translation?

#### Contrast

On a serious note, weâ€™d like to take a moment to acknowledge the challenges and hardships faced by people around the world,
whether due to conflict, natural disasters, violence, diseases, poverty or other tragedies.
Our thoughts are with everyone impacted by all kinds of events, we hope that music and communities like ours, can provide some solace,
joy, and unity.
We cannot ignore the fact that while we are preparing a cozy indoor set or a crowded beachside party,
for many people music and DJ-ing are a kind of unattainable luxury.
