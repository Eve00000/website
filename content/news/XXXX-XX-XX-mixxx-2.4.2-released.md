#### Winter and Summer are coming

Contrasts.
As the leaves fall and the first snowflakes start drifting down in the North, while the southern skies start warming up
with summer sun, we are thrilled to finally release Mixxx 2.4.2! "Finally" because a bit later than planned, perfection
can take some time. So we are proud to present you this release, a major bugfix-release for the 2.4 series before
stepping over to a new number.
Don't be scared, development won't hibernate.

#### Testing and translating

A special thank you to everyone who takes the time to test alpha and beta versions, to who report issues and proposals and to those
who propose features and improvements. Your feedback is invaluable.
A lot of new users and contributors have joined our community the past months, we'd like to welcome them all, spin it up,
your energy and fresh ideas have already left a mark.
Everybody can contribute to Mixxx. Did you find an error on the website, an incomplete subject in the manual, an error in translation?

[Contribute](https://mixxx.org/get-involved/).

#### Treasure hunt

When you dive into the code to add a feature or when you are looking for a function when you want to customize a mapping,
you can discover small little snippets, real pearls, the intensive work of someone to make a function smoother, to let an algorithm
work some milliseconds faster, to offer a conversion of a value to another without having to write it all over again.
For all these little snippets, for all these forgotten pearls: thank you to all who ever contributed.
