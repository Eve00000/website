#### Winter and Summer are coming

Contrasts.
As the leaves fall and the first snowflakes start drifting down in the North, while the southern skies start warming up
with summer sun, we are thrilled to finally release Mixxx 2.4.2! Finally because a bit later than planned, perfection can take some time. So we are proud to present you this release, a major bugfix-release for the
2.4 series before stepping over to a new number.
This release covers a lot of issues reported by our users and contains updates for many controller-mappings.
Don't be scared, development won't hibernate.

#### Testing and translating

A special thank you to everyone who takes the time to test alfa and beta versions, to who report issues and proposes and to those
who propose features and improvements. Your feedback is invaluable.
A lot of new users and contributors have joined our community the past months, we'd like to welcome them all, spin it up,
your energy and fresh ideas have already left a mark.
Everybody can contribute to Mixxx. Did you remark an error on the website, an incomplete subject in the manual, an error in translation?
