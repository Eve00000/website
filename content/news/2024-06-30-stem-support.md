## Explore New Creative Horizons with Mixxx's Latest Feature: Stem Mixing

We are excited to introduce a major new feature in Mixxx: Stem Mixing. This innovative tool, inspired by Native Instruments' concept from their Traktor Pro software, allows you to separate and manipulate different elements of a track in real-time. But what exactly are stems?

Stems are individual audio tracks that make up a complete song. Typically, a song is split into four main stems: drums, bassline, harmony, and vocals. By isolating these elements, you can remix, mashup, and edit tracks on the fly, providing a new level of flexibility and creativity in your DJ sets.

Mixxx now supports Native Instruments stem files, the current public specification for this format. Whether you're an amateur DJ eager to experiment with new techniques or a professional looking to enhance your performances, Stem Mixing in Mixxx offers powerful new capabilities to elevate your mixes.

# Paving the Way for AI-Generated Stems

The introduction of Stem Mixing in Mixxx is just the beginning of a revolutionary journey in DJing technology. This feature not only enhances your current capabilities but also sets the stage for future innovations, particularly in the realm of AI-generated stems. The Mixxx community is actively exploring ways to integrate artificial intelligence to create stems on the fly, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in live DJ performances.

Competitors like Virtual DJ and Algoriddim’s djay Pro AI have already implemented AI-driven stem separation, allowing DJs to extract individual elements from any track in real-time. These advancements highlight the potential and ambition we have for Mixxx. Our goal is to provide DJs with the most cutting-edge tools to unlock new levels of creativity and performance.

Imagine being able to instantly isolate vocals, drums, or other components from any track in your library, regardless of its original format. This capability would not only streamline the preparation process but also open up endless possibilities for live remixing and mashups. As the Mixxx community continues to develop and refine AI-driven features, we are committed to bringing these powerful tools to our users, ensuring that Mixxx remains at the forefront of DJing technology.

This topic is currently very active and hotly debated in our community chat on Zulip. If you are interested in contributing to this effort or just want to stay updated on the latest developments, we invite you to [join the discussion](https://mixxx.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/109171-development/topic/stem.20separation/near/439520527).
