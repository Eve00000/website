title: Mixxx Privacy Policy
slug: privacy-policy

## Introduction

Mixxx is a non-profit project, managed by volunteers.

There is no business-model around Mixxx, and the only revenue we receive is through donations.

For privacy policies and conformance to GDPR, a few distinctions will be done between:

- Mixxx application
- Main Mixxx website
- Community Mixxx websites

For each of the previous software/websites, we'll detail the different privacy policies.

## Mixxx Application

The Mixxx application doesn't use any user account, and does not collect any user data, when running.

Mixxx does not collect any data, nor any telemetry, when Mixxx is being run.
However, some limited personal information could be collected or shared in 3 precise cases:

- during the crash report process,
- during updates checking,
- for metadata retrieval.

## Mixxx Crash Reporting

The Mixxx application itself neither collects crash reports nor shares them.

Crash reports are handled by the Stores/Vendors of each platforms.
Please refer to those platforms for information about the privacy policies.
Depending on the platform, Mixxx Core Developers have access to these reports, which usually contain:

- Operating System version
- CPU and GPU
- Symbolic StackTrace of the process
- List of DLLs loaded by the process

None of these data is stored on Mixxx servers.

## Mixxx Update Mechanism

The Mixxx application itself doesn't provide an update mechanism.

Updates are handled by the Stores of each platforms, where the user has downloaded Mixxx from.
Please refer to those platforms for information about the privacy policies.

## Mixxx Metadata Requests

Mixxx can automatically search online for metadata associated to your media, to 3rd parties.
Those requests can contain information about the media, including artist, title, album, etc...
This metadata mechanism can be disabled at every moment, in Mixxx preferences.

The main 3rd parties that can be contacted by Mixxx, automatically is:

 - Mixxx MusicBrainz instance.

Please refer to those services for their own privacy policy.
Mixxx does not have access to any of those requests and data, except in the MusicBrainz case, detailed below, in this document.

## Mixxx Website

The main website of Mixxx, aka www.mixxx.org, does not create or use any user account.
There are no registration forms, or any similar mechanism.
Therefore, no personal information is stored at any moment, about the user, by Mixxx.

## Community Mixxx Websites

The community websites from Mixxx are related to development and community, and are the following:

- GitHub (Code, Issue Tracking, Wiki)
- Discourse Forum
- Zulip Chat

Each of those websites have different users system, but work in a similar way. User need to log in and have a profile, this requires the use of login data and cookies. Refer the privacy statements of these sites for details:

- You can find the GitHub Privacy Statement here: [https://docs.github.com/de/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement](https://docs.github.com/de/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)
- You can find the Privacy Policy of the Mixxx Discourse Forum here: [https://mixxx.discourse.group/privacy](https://mixxx.discourse.group/privacy)
- You can find the Zulip Privacy Policy here: [https://zulip.com/policies/privacy](https://zulip.com/policies/privacy)

One can modify their user information at any time, through the options of those websites.

## MusicBrainz

Mixxx is running a MusicBrainz instance, that can be used to find information about a music, and artist and so on.

Those automatic requests can contain information about the media, including artist, title, album, etcâ€¦

This metadata mechanism is accepted on the first run of Mixxx, and can be disabled at every moment, in Mixxx preferences.

The information sent does not contain any name, username, email from the user.

No information from the request is kept after the transaction.

The connection logs can contain some limited information (like user-agents) and partial search next to the IP.
