title: Mixxx Privacy Policy
slug: privacy-policy

## Introduction

Mixxx is a non-profit project, managed by volunteers.

There is no business-model around Mixxx, and the only revenue we receive is through donations.

For privacy policies and conformance to GDPR, a few distinctions will be done between:

- Mixxx application
- Main Mixxx website
- Community Mixxx websites

For each of the previous software/websites, we'll detail the different privacy policies.

## Mixxx Application

The Mixxx application doesn't use any user account, and does not collect any user data, when running.

Mixxx does not collect any data, nor any telemetry, when Mixxx is being run.
However, some limited personal information could be collected or shared in 3 precise cases:

- for metadata retrieval
- during the crash report process
- during automatic updates process

## Mixxx Metadata Requests

The Mixxx Application can automatically search online for metadata associated to your media, on 3rd partiy services.
This metadata mechanism can be disabled at every moment, in Mixxx preferences.
The information sent does not contain any name, username, email from the user, but these requests will
contain information about audio files on your computer, including artist, title, album, etc...

The 3rd party that can be contacted by Mixxx, automatically is:

 - MusicBrainz - For this service, please refer their Privacy Policy here: [https://metabrainz.org/privacy](https://metabrainz.org/privacy)

## Mixxx Crash Reporting

The Mixxx application itself neither collects crash reports nor shares them.

Crash reports are handled by the Stores/Vendors of each platforms.
Please refer to those platforms for information about the privacy policies.
Depending on the platform, Mixxx Core Developers have access to these reports, which usually contain:

- Operating System version
- CPU and GPU
- Symbolic StackTrace of the process
- List of DLLs loaded by the process

None of these data is stored on Mixxx servers.
In addition Mixxx writes a mixxx.log file which contains entries that may expose personal data. In a support case we may ask to share this file in public. This is a manual process during which you may obfuscate sensitive date before sharing.  
## Mixxx Update Mechanism

The Mixxx application itself doesn't provide an update mechanism.

In case updates are handled by the platform stores, where the user has downloaded Mixxx from,
please refer to those platforms for information about the privacy policies.


## Main Mixxx Website

The main website of Mixxx, aka www.mixxx.org, does not create or use any user account.
There are no registration forms, or any similar mechanism.
Therefore, no personal information is stored at any moment, about the user, by Mixxx.

## Community Mixxx Websites

The community websites from Mixxx are related to development and community, and are the following:

- GitHub (Code, Issue Tracking, Wiki)
- Discourse Forum
- Zulip Chat

Each of those websites have different users system, but work in a similar way. User need to log in and have a profile, this requires the use of login data and cookies. Refer the privacy statements of these sites for details:

- You can find the GitHub Privacy Statement here: [https://docs.github.com/de/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement](https://docs.github.com/de/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)
- You can find the Privacy Policy of the Mixxx Discourse Forum here: [https://mixxx.discourse.group/privacy](https://mixxx.discourse.group/privacy)
- You can find the Zulip Privacy Policy here: [https://zulip.com/policies/privacy](https://zulip.com/policies/privacy)

One can modify their user information at any time, through the options of those websites.
